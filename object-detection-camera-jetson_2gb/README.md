Access token: `Cx6XvAMbfbgQDmxZotq9`

This repository contains:
- `yolov4`: NAP YOLOv4 based Object Detection module. Useful for situations where it is required the detection of more classes than the ones provided by the NVIDIA Deepstream based module.
- `deepstream`: NAP NVIDIA Deepstream based Object Detection module. Useful for situations where it is expected just the need to detect vehicles and people, with a higher frame rate than the YOLOv4 based module.
